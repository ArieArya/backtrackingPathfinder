# Backtracking to Solve Pathfinding Problem
This project utilizes the backtracking algorithm to count the number of unique paths to traverse a 2D grid that passes through ALL available (or traversable) nodes. The project utilizes PyGames for visualization purposes where users can draw the shape of the map.

Examples of the algorithm's path visualization is shown below:
